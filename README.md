RENEGATE (Reaction Network Graph Theoretical tool) is a free program for automated reaction network exploration and analysis. It uses configurational root mean squared deviations (RMSD) to bias metadynamics simulations to perform exhaustive configurational search on the potential energy surface of the given input catalytic mixture. The resulting metadynamics trajectories are then analysed with the developed basic graph theoretical algorithms in order to identify the conformations and transitions between them that occur along dynamics to form reaction networks. Reaction networks are then trimmed based on thermodynamic tresholds. Renegate is a series of codes written in C, bash and Python and can be run on Linux machines.
